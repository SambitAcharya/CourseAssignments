/**

  Write a program to find the number of times that a given word(i.e. a short string) occurs in a sentence (i.e. a long string!). Read data from standard input. The first line is a single word, which is followed by general text on the second line. Read both up to a newline character, and insert a terminating null before processing.
  Typical output should be:
    The word is "the".
    The sentence is "the cat sat on the mat".
    “the” occured 2 times.
